# use-safe-window

Install

```bash
npm install use-safe-window
```

Use

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import useSafeWindow from "use-safe-window";

function App() {
  // origin will be `undefined` on the server
  const origin = useSafeWindow(window => window.location.origin);

  // [800, 450] on the server, replaced by the values from window on the client
  const [width, height] = useSafeWindow(
    window => [window.innerHeight, window.innerHeight],
    [800, 450]
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {origin} - {width} x {height}
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

## Why

I get the same error in every server-side rendered React project:

> `ReferenceError: window is not defined`

I got tired and published the code to npm.

The hook is just:

```js
function useSafeWindow(fn, def) {
  return typeof window !== "undefined" ? fn(window) : def;
}
```

Well, it's probably not even a hook but safe-window was already taken in npm ðŸ¤·
